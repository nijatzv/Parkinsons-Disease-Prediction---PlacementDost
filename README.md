## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a person has Parkinson's Disease based on various features. The dataset used for this project is sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons).

## Setup
To run this notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
